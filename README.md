Learning Plan: 

#1 Revising JS functions with notes and doing some practice exercises âœ…

- a function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
- // eg  Define a function called multiplyFive which accepts a number and returns that number multiplied by 5.

function multiplyFive(number) {
  return number * 5;
}

console.log(multiplyFive(2)); 

Write a function named minutesToHours that receives a number of minutes as parameter and returns a number representing the same amount of time but in hours.

function minutesToHours(minutes) {
    return minutes / 60; 
}

export { minutesToHours };

Write a function named max5 that receives 5 numbers as parameters and returns the biggest one between them.

function max5(nr1, nr2, nr3, nr4, nr5) {
  return Math.max(nr1, nr2, nr3, nr4, nr5);
}

export { max5 };
